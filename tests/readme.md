# How to run the tests

Just run `vendor/bin/phpunit` (or `vendor\bin\phpunit` in Windows) in the root of this package. If all is OK it will produce something like this:

```
PHPUnit 7.2.2 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

........................                                          24 / 24 (100%)

Time: 36 ms, Memory: 4.00MB

OK (24 tests, 97 assertions)
```
